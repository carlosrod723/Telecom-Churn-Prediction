## Project Overview
Churn analysis is a critical process for telecom companies as it helps them identify customers who are likely to leave the service provider and take their business elsewhere. This project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast customer churn, helping the company to take preventive actions.

The project also includes a feedback loop for continuous monitoring and retraining of the model to maintain its performance over time.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- AWS Account
- SQL Database (AWS RDS recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Carlosrod723/Telecom-Churn-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up the database connection in `config.py` (instructions will be added here).

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python, SQL
- **Cloud**: AWS
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data analysis and manipulation
  - `pyodbc`: For connecting with AWS cloud to fetch the data
  - `numpy`: For performing mathematical operations over data
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: For data visualization
  - `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`: For model building
  - `deepchecks`: For continuous model monitoring

## Usage
1. Load and preprocess the data using the `churn_modeling.ipynb` notebook.
2. Train and evaluate the model.
3. Monitor the model for data and model drift.
