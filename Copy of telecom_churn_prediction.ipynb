As telecom operators strive to meet the increasing demands of their customers, they face numerous challenges that can significantly impact their business success. To remain competitive, it's crucial for telecom companies to regularly analyze their data, identify emerging problems, and seize opportunities for improvement.\n","\n","This project is part of a series focused on \"telecom data,\" specifically targeting the challenges within the telecom industry. Before diving into this project, it's recommended to review the \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" notebook to gain a deeper understanding of the data.\n","\n","### **Aim**\n","\n","The primary goal of this churn prediction project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting which customers are likely to discontinue using a service. This is particularly important for businesses operating on a subscription or recurring revenue model, such as telecommunications companies.\n","\n","While the core of the project involves building a predictive churn model, the emphasis is on the importance of monitoring and adapting to changes in the data that might affect the model’s accuracy and effectiveness over time. Additionally, the project highlights the necessity of a feedback loop to continuously refine and improve the model based on new data and evolving business requirements. The overarching goal is to help businesses stay agile and adaptable in their machine learning strategies, beyond just focusing on the accuracy of a single model.\n","\n","### What is Churn Prediction?\n","\n","Churn prediction involves identifying customers who are likely to stop using a service or switch to a competitor. In the telecom sector, churn prediction helps companies identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain these customers.\n","\n","### **Challenges**\n","\n","Predicting churn is a complex problem, involving the analysis of large datasets from multiple sources. Telecom companies generate vast amounts of data from customer interactions, network performance, and billing systems, often stored in disparate systems. Analyzing this data to extract meaningful insights can be challenging.\n","\n","Another difficulty lies in the diversity of customer behaviors. Customers may leave for various reasons—some due to poor network performance, others due to better offers from competitors. Accurately predicting churn requires a deep understanding of these behaviors and identifying the most critical factors that influence churn.\n","\n","### **Business Impact of Churn Prediction**\n","\n","Churn prediction has significant implications for a telecom company's business. A high churn rate can lead to revenue loss and reduced profitability. Conversely, an effective churn prediction model allows companies to identify at-risk customers and take measures to retain them.\n","\n","Key business impacts include:\n","- **Revenue Protection**: By predicting churn, telecom companies can take proactive steps to retain customers, such as offering discounts or upgrading service plans, thereby protecting their revenue stream.\n","- **Customer Retention**: Understanding why customers leave enables companies to improve their services and enhance the customer experience, leading to higher retention rates.\n","- **Cost Reduction**: Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Churn prediction helps focus marketing efforts on the most valuable customers, reducing acquisition costs.\n","- **Competitive Advantage**: Effective churn prediction gives companies a competitive edge by improving customer loyalty and increasing market share.\n","\n","### **Approach**\n","\n","**Data Exploration**: Load the dataset and explore its structure and contents. Analyze the distribution of the target variable (churn) and the features.\n","\n","**Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values through imputation, address outliers, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.\n","\n","**Model Training**: Split the data into training and validation sets. Train models such as logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost. Evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and select the best-performing model.\n","\n","**Data Drift Monitoring**: Use tools like Deepchecks to monitor for data drift in input features and the target variable. Regularly check model performance to detect any signs of model drift.\n","\n","**Inference Pipeline**: Build an inference pipeline to predict churn for new data. Implement mechanisms to handle cases where labels are missing or where drift is detected, including model retraining with misclassified data.\n","\n","### **Project Summary**\n","\n","Summarize the model's predictions, draw insights, and provide recommendations for business actions based on the model’s outcomes.\n","\n","\n","## **Data Dictionary**\n","\n","This section provides an overview of the dataset's columns and their descriptions:\n","\n","| Column name | Description |\n","|-------------|-------------|\n","| Customer ID | Unique identifier for each customer |\n","| Month | Calendar Month- 1:12 |\n","| Month of Joining | Calendar Month -1:14, Month for which the data is captured |\n","| zip_code | Zip Code |\n","| Gender | Gender |\n","| Age | Age (Years) |\n","| Married | Marital Status |\n","| Dependents | Dependents - Binary |\n","| Number of Dependents | Number of Dependents |\n","| Location ID | Location ID |\n","| Service ID | Service ID |\n","| state | State |\n","| county | County |\n","| timezone | Timezone |\n","| area_codes | Area Code |\n","| country | Country |\n","| latitude | Latitude |\n","| longitude | Longitude |\n","| arpu | Average revenue per user |\n","| roam_ic | Roaming incoming calls in minutes |\n","| roam_og | Roaming outgoing calls in minutes |\n","| loc_og_t2t | Local outgoing calls within same network in minutes |\n","| loc_og_t2m | Local outgoing calls outside network in minutes (outside same + partner network) |\n","| loc_og_t2f | Local outgoing calls with Partner network in minutes |\n","| loc_og_t2c | Local outgoing calls with Call Center in minutes |\n","| std_og_t2t | STD outgoing calls within same network in minutes |\n","| std_og_t2m | STD outgoing calls outside network in minutes (outside same + partner network) |\n","| std_og_t2f | STD outgoing calls with Partner network in minutes |\n","| std_og_t2c | STD outgoing calls with Call Center in minutes |\n","| isd_og | ISD Outgoing calls |\n","| spl_og | Special Outgoing calls |\n","| og_others | Other Outgoing Calls |\n","| loc_ic_t2t | Local incoming calls within same network in minutes |\n","| loc_ic_t2m | Local incoming calls outside network in minutes (outside same + partner network) |\n","| loc_ic_t2f | Local incoming calls with Partner network in minutes |\n","| std_ic_t2t | STD incoming calls within same network in minutes |\n","| std_ic_t2m | STD incoming calls outside network in minutes (outside same + partner network) |\n","| std_ic_t2f | STD incoming calls with Partner network in minutes |\n","| std_ic_t2o | STD incoming calls operators other networks in minutes |\n","| spl_ic | Special Incoming calls in minutes |\n","| isd_ic | ISD Incoming calls in minutes |\n","| ic_others | Other Incoming Calls |\n","| total_rech_amt | Total Recharge Amount in Local Currency |\n","| total_rech_data | Total Recharge Amount for Data in Local Currency |\n","| vol_4g | 4G Internet Used in GB |\n","| vol_5g | 5G Internet used in GB |\n","| arpu_5g | Average revenue per user over 5G network |\n","| arpu_4g | Average revenue per user over 4G network |\n","| night_pck_user | Is Night Pack User (Specific Scheme) |\n","| fb_user | Social Networking scheme |\n","| aug_vbc_5g | Volume Based cost for 5G network (outside the scheme paid based on extra usage) |\n","| offer | Offer Given to User |\n","| Referred a Friend | Referred a Friend : Binary |\n","| Number of Referrals | Number of Referrals |\n","| Phone Service | Phone Service: Binary |\n","| Multiple Lines | Multiple Lines for phone service: Binary |\n","| Internet Service | Internet Service: Binary |\n","| Internet Type | Internet Type |\n","| Streaming Data Consumption | Streaming Data Consumption |\n","| Online Security | Online Security |\n","| Online Backup | Online Backup |\n","| Device Protection Plan | Device Protection Plan |\n","| Premium Tech Support | Premium Tech Support |\n","| Streaming TV | Streaming TV |\n","| Streaming Movies | Streaming Movies |\n","| Streaming Music | Streaming Music |\n","| Unlimited Data | Unlimited Data |\n","| Payment Method | Payment Method |\n","| Status ID | Status ID |\n","| Satisfaction Score | Satisfaction Score |\n","| Churn Category | Churn Category |\n","| Churn Reason | Churn Reason |\n","| Customer Status | Customer Status |\n","| Churn Value | Binary Churn Value |\n","\n","## Target Feature: Churn Value\n","\n","The target feature for this analysis is the **`Churn Value`** column.

By the 99th percentile, age reaches 74 years, indicating a diverse age range within the customer base.\n","  \n","- **Number of Dependents**: The number of dependents remains 0 up to the 75th percentile, increasing gradually afterward. By the 99th percentile, the number reaches 9, suggesting that most customers have few or no dependents, with a small segment having larger families.\n","\n","- **Roaming and Call Variables**: Metrics such as `roam_ic`, `roam_og`, `loc_og_t2t`, and `std_og_t2t` show significant variation across quantiles, particularly at higher levels (e.g., 90th percentile and above), indicating that a small percentage of customers have exceptionally high usage, potentially marking them as outliers.\n","\n","- **Data Usage (`vol_4g`, `vol_5g`)**: Both 4G and 5G data usage show a sharp increase across higher quantiles. For instance, the 75th percentile for 4G data usage is 1089 GB, but this jumps to 11367 GB by the 99th percentile, showing that a small group of users are heavy data consumers.\n","\n","- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: ARPU for both 4G and 5G sees significant increases in higher quantiles, with extreme outliers at the 99th percentile, where values reach 254,687. This suggests the presence of very high-revenue users, which may need special consideration in the analysis.\n","\n","- **Satisfaction Score**: Satisfaction scores remain relatively low across quantiles, with a median score of 3. This may indicate a general dissatisfaction among the customer base, which could correlate with churn.\n","\n","- **Streaming Data Consumption**: Streaming data consumption gradually increases across quantiles, indicating diverse usage patterns among customers, with the highest quantiles representing heavy streamers.\n","\n","### Summary\n","The quantile analysis highlights the presence of significant variation in usage patterns across customers. Particularly in the higher quantiles, we observe potential outliers with exceptionally high usage and ARPU values. These outliers could have a substantial impact on the overall analysis and may require further investigation to determine their influence on predictive models.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HmxzTrl-sULL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Further investigation: Check the quantiles for the 'arpu_4g' specifically\n","df['arpu_4g'].quantile([0.75, 0.8, 0.9,

Over time, the data that the model encounters during real-world use may change from the data on which the model was originally trained. These changes can significantly affect the model's performance, leading to inaccurate predictions and unreliable outcomes.\n","\n","#### Types of Drift:\n","1. **Data Drift**:\n","   Data drift refers to any change in the distribution of the input data. For instance, if a government initiative suddenly enables more people to obtain higher education, the distribution of education levels in a dataset predicting income might shift. However, this does not necessarily alter the relationship between education and income—just the distribution of the input data.\n","\n","2. **Concept Drift**:\n","   Concept drift occurs when the relationship between the input data and the target label changes over time. For example, in a dataset predicting income based on education, if the job market changes such that work experience becomes more valuable than formal education, the model's predictions will become less accurate over time unless it is retrained.\n","\n","#### Importance of Detecting Drift:\n","Detecting drift is crucial because it serves as an early warning that the model's performance may degrade on new data. In many production environments, drift detection might be the only indicator that a model needs to be retrained or adjusted. By proactively monitoring for drift, machine learning practitioners can ensure that their models remain accurate and reliable, even as the underlying data changes.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"eJxMki_ZtZkL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define categorical and continuous columns\n","pred_cat_cols= [\n","    'Gender_Female', 'Gender_Male', 'Gender_Not Specified', 'Gender_Other',\n","    'Married_No', 'Married_Not Specified', 'Married_Yes', 'Dependents_No',\n","    'Dependents_Not Specified', 'Dependents_Yes', 'offer_A', 'offer_B',\n","    'offer_C', 'offer_D', 'offer_E', 'offer_F', 'offer_G', 'offer_H',\n","    'offer_I', 'offer_J', 'offer_No Offer', 'Referred a Friend_No',\n","    'Referred a Friend_Yes', 'Phone Service_No', 'Phone Service_Yes',\n","    'Multiple Lines_No', 'Multiple Lines_None', 'Multiple Lines_Yes',\n","    'Internet Service_No', 'Internet Service_Yes', 'Internet Type_Cable',\n","    'Internet Type_DSL', 'Internet Type_Fiber Optic', 'Internet Type_None',\n","    'Internet Type_Not Applicable', 'Online Security_No',\n","    'Online Security_Yes', 'Online Backup_No', 'Online Backup_Yes',\n","    'Device Protection Plan_No', 'Device Protection Plan_Yes',\n","    'Premium Tech Support_No', 'Premium Tech Support_Yes',\n","    'Streaming TV_No', 'Streaming TV_Yes', 'Streaming Movies_No',\n","    'Streaming Movies_Yes', 'Streaming Music_No', 'Streaming Music_Yes',\n","    'Unlimited Data_No', 'Unlimited Data_None', 'Unlimited Data_Yes',\n","    'Payment Method_Bank Withdrawal', 'Payment Method_Credit Card',\n","    'Payment Method_Wallet Balance'\n","]\n","\n","pred_cts_cols= [\n","    'Age', 'Number of Dependents', 'roam_ic', 'roam_og', 'loc_og_t2t',\n","    'loc_og_t2m', 'loc_og_t2f', 'loc_og_t2c', 'std_og_t2t', 'std_og_t2m',\n","    'std_og_t2f', 'std_og_t2c', 'isd_og', 'spl_og', 'og_others',\n","    'loc_ic_t2t', 'loc_ic_t2m', 'loc_ic_t2f', 'std_ic_t2t', 'std_ic_t2m',\n","    'std_ic_t2f', 'std_ic_t2o', 'spl_ic', 'isd_ic', 'ic_others',\n","    'total_rech_amt', 'total_rech_data', 'vol_4g', 'vol_5g', 'arpu_5g',\n","    'arpu_4g', 'arpu', 'aug_vbc_5g', 'Number of Referrals',\n","    'Streaming Data Consumption', 'Satisfaction Score', 'total_recharge'\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"a3-4rBvVyPZh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725029753178,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":205,"user":{"displayName":"Carlos Rodriguez","userId":"04567056169439968244"}}},"execution_count":78,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Function to check data drift when label is available\n","def check_data_drift_with_label(ref_df: pd.DataFrame, cur_df: pd.DataFrame, target: str, predictors: list, job_id: str):\n","    ref_features= [col for col in predictors if col in ref_df.columns]\n","    cur_features= [col for col in predictors if col in cur_df.columns]\n","    ref_cat_features= [col for col in pred_cat_cols if col in ref_df.columns]\n","    cur_cat_features= [col for col in pred_cat_cols if col in cur_df.columns]\n","    ref_dataset= Dataset(ref_df, label=target, features=ref_features, cat_features=ref_cat_features)\n","    cur_dataset= Dataset(cur_df, label=target, features=cur_features, cat_features=cur_cat_features)\n","\n","    suite= Suite(\"data drift\",\n","        NewLabelTrainTest(),\n","        WholeDatasetDrift().add_condition_overall_drift_value_less_than(0.2),\n","        FeatureLabelCorrelationChange().add_condition_feature_pps_difference_less_than(0.2),\n","        TrainTestFeatureDrift().add_condition_drift_score_less_than(0.2),\n","        TrainTestLabelDrift(balance_classes=True).add_condition_drift_score_less_than(0.4)\n","    )\n","    r= suite.run(train_dataset= ref_dataset, test_dataset= cur_dataset)\n","    retrain= (len(r.get_not_ran_checks()) > 0) or (len(r.get_not_passed_checks()) > 0)\n","\n","    return {\"report\": r, \"retrain\": retrain}\n","\n","# Function to check model drift\n","def check_model_drift(model, pred_data, label):\n","    dmatrix= xgb.DMatrix(pred_data)\n","    label_pred= model.predict(dmatrix)\n","    test_f1_score= f1_score(label, label_pred)\n","    test_recall= recall_score(label, label_pred)\n","\n","    print(\"\\nTest Results\")\n","    print(f'F1 Score: {test_f1_score}')\n","    print(f'Recall Score: {test_recall}')\n","    print(f'Confusion Matrix: \\n{confusion_matrix(label, label_pred)}')\n","    print(f'Area Under Curve: {roc_auc_score(label, label_pred)}')\n","\n","    #

Here’s what these numbers mean in practical terms for the company:\n","\n","1. **Logistic Regression**:\n","   - **Low Recall on Test Data (0.2457)**: The model has difficulty identifying customers who are likely to churn. In a business context, this means that many customers who might leave the service are not being flagged by the model, leading to missed opportunities for targeted retention efforts.\n","   - **Low F1 Score on Test Data (0.3333)**: The balance between precision and recall is poor, suggesting that even when the model does predict churn, it is not reliable. This could lead to unnecessary marketing spend on customers who were not likely to leave.\n","\n","2. **Random Forest**:\n","   - **High Overfitting**: The model performs extremely well on training data but poorly on test data, indicating that it may be learning noise rather than useful patterns. In a real-world setting, this could result in the company being unable to accurately predict churn in new customers, leading to ineffective retention strategies.\n","   - **Moderate Test Recall (0.3946)**: While better than Logistic Regression, the recall is still not high enough, meaning many at-risk customers may not be identified, affecting the company's ability to proactively reduce churn.\n","\n","3. **XGBoost**:\n","   - **Better Generalization (Test Recall of 0.4331)**: XGBoost offers a more balanced approach, with the highest recall on test data among the models. This means it is better at identifying customers who are likely to churn, allowing the business to target these customers with retention campaigns more effectively.\n","   - **Improved F1 Score (0.4929)**: The F1 score indicates a better trade-off between precision and recall, suggesting that XGBoost makes more reliable predictions. For the telecom business, this model would help reduce unnecessary spending on customers who are not actually at risk of churning while focusing efforts on those who are.\n","\n","### Business Implications\n","\n","For the telecom business, accurately predicting churn is vital for maintaining customer base and revenue. The recall metric, in particular, is critical as it reflects the model's ability to identify all customers who are at risk of leaving. Low recall, as seen in the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, means that many potential churners go undetected, leading to higher churn rates and lost revenue.\n","\n","XGBoost, with its higher recall and better F1 score on test data, presents a more reliable model for churn prediction. By using this model, the business can more effectively identify customers at risk of churning and implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers or interventions, to keep these customers engaged and reduce overall churn rates.\n","\n","In conclusion, while no model is perfect, XGBoost currently offers the best balance between precision and recall, making it the most effective tool among the ones tested for predicting customer churn and enabling proactive business strategies to retain valuable customers.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4gcIdAmbRooH"}}]}
